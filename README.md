### âš¡ Heeeeeellllllooo âš¡

Good to know that you get time to checkout my GitHub. 

I am Senior Undergraduate at IIT Madras, pursuing B.Tech in Mechanical engineering and M.Tech in Data Science. I love to work on coool stuff related to data science and Natural Language Processing. I am fascinated by the idea ðŸ¤” that how AI is making our lives more comfortable and how people are making tons of money by taking advantage of human's laziness.

I have done some research work on Transformers (especially, Low resource Machine Translation System) and did open-source contribution to some of the repositaries of HuggingFace. I am looking for working on cool projects involving transformers.

Feel free to contact me if you want my help in the project related to data science. I would love to help. ðŸ‘¯
