### âš¡ Yoooooo âš¡

Glad to know that you found time to checkout my GitHub. 

I am a Senior Undergraduate at IIT Madras, pursuing B.Tech. in Mechanical engineering and M.Tech. in Data Science. I love to work on coool stuff related to Data Science and Natural Language Processing. Apart from working on some coool projects, I love to build tools for easying survival in deep learning :)

I have done some research work on Transformers (especially, Low resource Machine Translation System) and currently doing open-source contribution to some of the repositaries of HuggingFace. I am looking for working on cool projects involving transformers.

I am fascinated by the idea ðŸ¤” how AI is making our lives more comfortable and how people are making tons of money by taking advantage of human's laziness.
Feel free to contact me if you want my help in the project related to data science. I would love to help.
