⚡ README ⚡

I am a 3rd year undergraduate at IIT Madras, pursuing Data Science. I love to work on coool projects related to Data Science & NLP; and love building tools for easying survival in deep learning. I have previously worked on summarization, translation, question-answering using SOTA transformers and currently involved in several competitions involving ML & analytics.

I am currently working on porting [`BigBird`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/10183) to `HuggingFace`. I am looking for Summer internship 2021 in NLP, data science, deep learning. Feel free to connect with me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasudevgupta7/) or [Gmail](7vasudevgupta@gmail.com), incase you are looking for an intern.
